Task 1: Bakery profile → complete brand with storytelling &amp; navigation. 
Every great brand has a story waiting to be told. When I discovered Zed The Baker's original MyTribe page, I found a gem hidden in plain sight—a passionate baker with a dream to bring Parisian vibes to Bengaluru, but his digital presence was just a simple list of products with prices. The soul, the story, the magic of "flour on hands and butter in hair" was buried beneath basic text.

This redesign became a mission: transform a forgotten profile into a digital experience that makes your mouth water and your heart feel warm.

The Challenge
The Original Page Had:

* Just 4 product listings with prices

* No navigation or structure

* Zero brand personality

* No location information

* No way to connect or engage

The Vision Became:

* A complete brand experience

* The founder's inspiring journey

* Mouth-watering service showcases

* Easy-to-find Bengaluru locations

* A website that feels like walking into a Parisian bakery


What Design Decisions That Made the Difference
1. From Products to Stories
Before: "The Fudge Factor - $9.99 - Order Now"
After: "Artisan Bakery & Café – We bake Parisian croissants, cheesecakes, handcrafted macarons, and artisan confectionary."

Why? People don't just buy products—they buy experiences, memories, and the promise of that perfect first bite.

2. From Anonymous to Personal
Before: No story, just items
After: "Hey, I'm Zed The Baker. Started out in 2018 with a wild idea—bring Paris vibes right into Bengaluru."

Why? Behind every great bakery is a baker with a dream. Share the dream, and customers become part of the journey.

3. From Hidden to Accessible
Before: No locations listed
After: Indiranagar · Cunningham Road · Church Street · Bowring Institute

Why? A beautiful website means nothing if customers can't find you. Make it easy for them to visit.
