Task 1: Restaurant Website Transformation
 The Story Behind the Redesign
Every great restaurant has a story waiting to be savored. When I discovered Svarasa Indian Kitchen's original website, I found a treasure of authentic Indian flavors hidden behind a heavy, text-heavy design. The philosophy of "taste begins with truth" was there, but it was buried under cluttered information and uninviting visuals.

This redesign became a mission: transform a basic restaurant page into a warm, inviting digital space that feels like stepping into an authentic Indian kitchen.

Before Design :<img width="1208" height="5396" alt="svarasakitchen com_" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f499bd1-99aa-40ad-a444-8e9dcf7094ee" />


->The Challenge
The Original Page Had:
* Heavy hero image with unreadable text overlay

* No clear navigation or structure

* Scattered information (reservations, hours, location all disconnected)

* Zero visual hierarchy

* No brand identity or warmth

* Generic template feel

->The Vision Became:
* A warm, terracotta-infused color palette

* Clear, inviting hero section with logo and simple intro

* Smooth horizontal sliding cards for offerings

* Powerful storytelling section ("taste begins with truth")

* Fully integrated reservation system

* Working Google Maps for easy location access

* A website that feels like home-cooked comfort

-> Design Decisions That Made the Difference
1. From Heavy to Welcoming
Before: Dark, overwhelming hero image with repeated text
After: Clean hero section with elegant logo, simple tagline, and warm spices imagery

Why? First impressions matter. A restaurant website should welcome you, not overwhelm you.

2. From Scattered to Organized
Before: Reservations, special requests, hours all in different places
After: Unified reservation card with form, WhatsApp integration, and complete info block

Why? Customers should find everything they need in one intuitive flow.

3. From Generic to Authentic
Before: No brand personality
After: "At Svarasa, taste begins with truth" – a powerful philosophy brought to life with elegant typography and warm imagery

Why? Authenticity builds trust. Showcasing their commitment to honest cooking creates emotional connection.

4. From Static to Interactive
Before: Basic text links
After: Smooth horizontal sliding cards showcasing 6 offerings, each with hover effects

Why? Interactive elements engage users and make exploration fun.

5. From Hidden to Accessible
Before: Hard-to-find location info
After: Prominent location block with working Google Maps, clear address, and hours

Why? If customers can't find you, they can't visit you.
